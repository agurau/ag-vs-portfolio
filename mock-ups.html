            <h2>Pro Patrimonio Foundation Web Prototype 1</h2>
            <p>
              Images edited with Adobe XD. Desktop screen size: 1920px. The
              first prototype was the initial design chosen for Pro Patrimonio
              Foundation, a charity that aims to protect, rehabilitate and
              educate about Romanian heritage. For the re-design of its <a href="https://www.propatrimonio.org/?lang=en">original website</a>,
              I decided to go for a lighter look with less options in the
              navigation bar, as I believe the user could feel overwhelmed with
              the multiple choices at the beggining. This could make the visitor get lost in the website or
              loose interest. For the same reason, I decided to present more clear information in the home page showing the user what can be found if navigating through the website. In addition, I chose a more visual
              design to showcase the past and current projects from Pro
              Patrimonio. The titles, such as Our projects and Workshops are
              clickable buttons that will take the user to the correct page. I
              also believe that having clear values at the top of the website
              makes it easier for the user to understand what Pro Patrimonio
              stands for. My next step was deciding which kind of content to add
              before asking the user to join as a member or to donate money to
              the organisation. Then, I created a section about Discovering
              Romania with interesting information about this beautiful country,
              as it might stil be unknown for many people. The design chosen is
              again mainly visual with a short and sharp title. The first image
              has a larger size to create an impact into the reader, with the
              aim of make him/her click in the button and keep navigating
              through the website. The footer was based in four columns.

            <h2>Pro Patrimonio Foundation Web Prototype 2</h2>
            <p>
              Desktop screen size: 1920px. For the second prototype I decided to
              take a even more visually approach. I have added more options to the
              navigation bar, but I sill believe that are less overwhelming than
              the current options on Pro Patrimonio website, as I have only chosen
              clear links to key pages. The colour is now a dark red-brown
              option because I ran the Colour Contrast Analyser and I realised that
              the previous colour did not met all the criterias for visibility
              in smaller devices. In addition, I believe that this new colour
              matches with the colour paletter of Pro Patrimonio images. I added the
              image of the award that Pro Patrimonio recently won and that is
              currently at the top of their website, but I cut the right end as
              it was not visually appealing (They have renewed the top image in November for a better option). I also included the name of the
              Vice-President of the charity, as it provides to the values a more
              personal touch. <br> <br> Other changes are: the following section has
              buttons included, Discovering Romania has larger pictures to capt
              the attention of the users, as well as the images from Join,
              Donate, Shop and Travel sections, giving more relevance to these
              parts in the website. I have also added a section for News before
              the reminder to subscribe to the newsletter at the top of the
              footer and a Volunteering part. This will be beneficiail for
              Pro Patrimonio because charities are actively seeking help. The Recipes
              and Music workshop section have also more importance in the
              layout. The footer has been alligned to the 16 lines of initial
              design that has been followed for both prototypes and a slogan has
              been added to remind the user the mission of the organisation.
              <br> <br> Downsides: I have used the only English logo from Pro Patrimonio
              that I have found in internet. However, it is impossible to read
              The Romanian National Trust as it becomes too small. The logo
              should be re-designed and I highly recommend to use an English
              version to make the organisation more inclusive for international
              users, as they are also based in the UK. The design for boxes along the website might look differently to this design as it might find some difficulties while coding to align some titles such as Master Our Recipes with the box border line.

            <h2>Pro Patrimonio Foundation Mobile Prototype</h2>
            <p>
              Width screen size: 375 px - iPhone 6, 7, 8 and SE. The mobile
              design follows the second desktop prototype in terms of colors,
              layout and content. A hamburguer menu has been colocated on the
              right to hide the options the user can use to navigate around the
              website. This approach is considered more approapiate for smaller
              devices. I have also encountered the same problem as previously
              with the desktop design regarding the typography of the logo (this
              has to be redesigned in the future). Footer follows a two columns
              layout.Their original footer and some parts of the website are not currently responsive in smaller devices, hence my design could be a great improvement for their website.
